Here we classify all topological spaces where all bijections to itself are
homeomorphisms. As a consequence, we also classify all topological spaces where
all maps to itself are continuous. Analogously, we classify all measurable
spaces where all bijections to itself are measurable with measurable inverse.
As a consequence, we also classify all measurable spaces where all maps to
itself are measurable.
